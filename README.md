# Plant-Business-Dashboard
This repository hosts the database for the Plants with Pliers business, a small plant startup. The data, initially collected using SQL, has been imported into Power BI via ODBC for visualization and analysis. The repository provides an organized structure for the database, including SQL scripts, Power BI files, and documentation.
